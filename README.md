User starts with entering amount of a and phi variables. User can also set time period for system modeling(*L1- start, L2 - end*)

Next window allows user to set amount of points for multipoints conditions

Then user can set up all vector functions in form. In right part of the system user can preview his unput before solving. It is updated dynamicaly
